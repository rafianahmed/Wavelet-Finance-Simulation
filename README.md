# 📈 Wavelet Analysis for Financial Markets

An interactive finance-focused Wavelet Transform simulation built with pure JavaScript and deployed via GitHub Pages.

This project demonstrates how multi-scale signal decomposition can be used in quantitative finance to analyze volatility regimes, dominant trading horizons, and market structure.

## 📚 Why Wavelets in Finance?

Traditional Fourier analysis decomposes signals purely in frequency space and loses time localization.

Wavelet Transform preserves BOTH:

• Time information  
• Frequency information  

This makes wavelets powerful for financial markets where:

- Volatility clustering occurs
- Regime shifts happen
- Multi-horizon trading strategies coexist
- Market microstructure noise contaminates returns
